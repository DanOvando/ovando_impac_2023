:::: {.columns}

- Protected areas asked to play a growing role in **ecosystem-based management**
  
  - Protect 30% of land and water in the coming decade.
  
- Modern protected areas first seen as refuges from the outside world
  
- Protection has wider impacts
  
  - "spillover" of adult or larval organisms
  
  - Displacement of human activities

# What effects do protected areas have on populations?

## MPAs - The Evidence

> The jury is in on marine reserves: They work.
> Research has repeatedly shown that fish numbers quickly climb following well-enforced fishing bans, 
> creating tangible benefits for fishers who work the surrounding waters.

## MPAs - The Evidence

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%}

- MPAs seem simple: 
  - *Less fishing, more fish*

- Ample evidence of **more everything** inside MPAs than outside

- Problem solved?

  - Fish and Fishers move

  - What do we do when the **treatment** affects the **control**

## What Happend in the Channel Islands?

Trend for species targeted by fishing... Looks promising!

## Estimating Population-Level Effects

### General form

$$(log(D_{MPA=1, T = 1})-log(D_{MPA=0, T = 1}))-(log(D_{MPA = 1,T = 0})-log(D_{MPA =0, T = 0}))$$


### Bayesian Gamma GLM 

$$d_{i} \sim Gamma(e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1T_{i} +  \beta_2MPA_{i} + \beta_{3}T_iMPA_i + \mathbf{B^cX_i} + \mathbf{B^sS_i}},shape)$$


### Hierarchical clustering of sites by island
$$\mathbf{B^s} \sim N(\beta_r,\sigma_r)$$

## Effects of Protected Areas

::: columns
::: {.column width = "50%"}

- Protected areas can support ecosystem-based management

- Critical to consider effects **inside** and **outside**

-  **Population** effects may be smaller and harder to find than conventionally thought

- Does not mean there are not benefits
  - But may impede adaptive management
  
- Communities should have a clear understanding of expected effects of protected areas

## The Catch-22 of MPA Design

The **closer** your control site, the more risk of spillover. The **further**, the less likely it is a valid environmental control
