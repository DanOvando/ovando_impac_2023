# A Quantiative Fisheries Ecologist


> I use methods and ideas from ecology and economics to help understand and manage social-ecological systems. 


I study...
  
  - Fisheries assessment and management
  
  - Social-ecological impacts of policies
  
  - Predictive modeling
  
Using ...
 
  - Bayesian methods
 
  - Econometrics
 
  - Simulation modeling
 
  - Open and reproducible science
  
  - Null results?

.center[**An Optimistic Skeptic**]


What do I mean by an optimistic skeptic? Social-ecological systems are complicated. This both complicates our ability to clearly understand what is happening in them, and to identify simple solutions to complex problems. Hence, "skeptic": my prior is that uncertainty and complexity are the norm. Optimist though: I believe that science can help us navigate this uncertainty and complexity in a productive way, to help us move slowly towards better understanding and better outcomes.

### Assessment Science

1. How many fish **are there**?

2. How many fish **can we catch**?

We answer these using **stock assessments**

# A Flexible Assessment Model

Core tool of our research:  [`sraplus`](https://danovando.github.io/sraplus/)

Pella-Tomlinson surplus production model with process error


$$B_{t + 1} = \left(B_{t} + B_{t}\frac{r}{m - 1}\left(1 - \left(\frac{B_t}{K}\right)^{m- 1}\right) - c_t\right)p_t$$
$$log(p_t) \sim {N}\left(\frac{-\sigma_{proc}^2}{2},\sigma_{proc}\right)$$

  - But it hasn't happened yet. 
  
**Uncertainty and complexity are the norm**

### The optimism...

- There are lessons in null-results

- Slow progress towards better understanding and better outcomes

**Science can help us navigate uncertainty and complexity**

What do I mean by an optimistic skeptic? Social-ecological systems are complicated. This both complicates our ability to clearly understand what is happening in them, and to identify simple solutions to complex problems. Hence, "skeptic": my prior is that uncertainty and complexity are the norm. Optimist though: I believe that science can help us navigate this uncertainty and complexity in a productive way, to help us move slowly towards better understanding and better outcomes.

# How many fish can we catch?

# How Many Fish Are There?

Two general options

  1. Conduct fishery-independent surveys
    
    - Research trawls, acoustics, visual surveys, etc.
    
    - Accurate (hopefully) but expensive
    
  2. Depend on data from the fishery
   
    - Fisheries captures
   
    - Catch-per-unit-effort
   
    - Cheaper but often biased


---

# How Many Can we Catch?


To contextualize numbers, we fit **population dynamics** models
    
  - Births
  
  - Deaths
  
  - Growth


using ideally fishery **dependent** and **independent** data

These models estimate **stock status** relative to **reference points**
  
  - Unfished biomass
  
  - Biomass that would maximize long-term catch
  
  - Sustainability of fishing effort
